# Oil Spill Detection using Attention U-Net

A deep learning system for detecting oil spills in SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite images using Attention U-Net architecture. The system supports semantic segmentation of images into three categories: Oil, Lookalike, and No oil.

**Recommended Model:** `attention_unet_oil_spill_improved.pth` (Weighted BCE) - Achieves better F1-Score (65.6%) and IoU (48.8%) compared to standard BCE.

## Features

- **Attention U-Net Architecture**: Advanced segmentation model with attention gates for improved feature selection
- **Multi-Category Support**: Handles Oil, Lookalike, and No oil image categories
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: IoU, F1 score, Precision, and Recall evaluation
- **WandB Integration**: Experiment tracking and visualization with Weights & Biases
- **PyTorch Implementation**: Efficient training and inference using PyTorch
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive notebooks for training and evaluation

## Data Preparation

### Dataset Source

This project uses **Sentinel-1 SAR** satellite imagery for oil spill detection. The dataset should contain preprocessed SAR images in GeoTIFF format.


### Directory Structure

Organize your SAR satellite images in the following structure:

```

```

### Image Format

- **Input Images**: Sentinel-1 SAR images in **GeoTIFF (.tif)** format
- **Masks**: Binary segmentation masks in **GeoTIFF (.tif)** format
  - White (255) = Oil spill/lookalike region
  - Black (0) = Background/Ocean
- **Naming**: Zero-padded numeric format (e.g., `00000.tif`, `00001.tif`)
- **Image Size**: Automatically resized to 256×256 during training

### Supported Categories

1. **Oil**: SAR images containing actual oil spills (dark patches)
2. **Lookalike**: SAR images with features resembling oil spills:
   - Algae blooms
   - Low wind areas
   - Rain cells
   - Biogenic slicks
3. **No Oil**: Clean ocean SAR images without oil or lookalikes

## Model Architecture

The Attention U-Net architecture consists of:

- **Encoder**: 4 levels with convolutional blocks and max pooling
- **Bottleneck**: Deep feature extraction layer
- **Decoder**: 4 levels with attention gates and upsampling
- **Attention Gates**: Focus on relevant spatial regions during upsampling
- **Output**: Single-channel binary segmentation mask

### Key Components

- **ConvBlock**: Double convolution with batch normalization and ReLU
- **AttentionGate**: Attention mechanism for skip connections
- **UpConv**: Upsampling with convolution

## Usage
